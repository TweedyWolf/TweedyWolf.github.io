        <p class="bold-pink">The nucleus is a cell organelle that contains the cell's genetic material, and is the cell's control center. It is also known as the "brain" of the cell. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane, and contains chromosomes made up of DNA molecules and proteins.</p>

        <p class="bold-pink">The nucleus is an organelle found in eukaryotic (having nucleus) cells. Inside its fully-enclosed nuclear membrane, it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as DNA molecules, along with a variety of proteins, to form chromosomes. The nucleus is made up of a double membrane.</p>

        <p class="bold-pink">In biology, the structure in a cell that contains the chromosomes. The nucleus has a membrane around it, and is where RNA is made from the DNA in the chromosomes.</p>

        <p class="bold-pink">By housing the cell's genome, the nucleus serves both as the repository of genetic information and as the cell's control center. DNA replication, transcription, and RNA processing all take place within the nucleus, with only the final stage of gene expression (translation) localized to the cytoplasm.</p>
